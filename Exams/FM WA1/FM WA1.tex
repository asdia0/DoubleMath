    \problem{}
        \textbf{Do not use a calculator in answering this question.}

        The sequence of positive numbers, $u_n$, satisfies the recurrence relation:

        \[
            u_{n+1} = \sqrt{2u_n + 3}, \qquad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
        \]

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the sequence converges to $m$, find the value of $m$.
            \item By using a graphical approach, explain why $m < u_{n_1} < u_n$ when $u_n > u_m$. Hence, determine the behaviour of the sequence when $u_1 > m$.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            Observe that
            \begin{align*}
                \lim_{n \to \infty} u_n &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt{2u_{n-1} + 3}\\
                &= \sqrt{2\lim_{n \to \infty} u_{n-1} + 3}\\
                &= \sqrt{2\lim_{n \to \infty} u_n + 3}
            \end{align*}
            Since the sequence converges to $m$, we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} u_n = m$. Thus,
            \begin{alignat*}{2}
                &&m &= \sqrt{2m + 3}\\
                \implies&&m^2 &= 2m+3\\
                \implies&&m^2-2m-3&=0\\
                \implies&&(m-3)(m+1) &= 0
            \end{alignat*}
            Thus, $m = 3$ or $m = -1$. Since $u_n$ is always positive, we take $m = 3$.

    \problem{}
        Two expedition teams are to climb a vertical distance of 8100 m from the foot to the peak of a mountain. Team $A$ plans to cover a vertical distance of 400 m on the first day. On each subsequent day, the vertical distance covered is 5 m less than the vertical distance covered in the previous day. Team $B$ plans to cover a vertical distance of 800 m on the first day. On each subsequent day, the vertical distance covered is 90\% of the vertical distance covered in the previous day.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the number of days required for Team $A$ to reach the peak.
            \item Explain why Team $B$ will never be able to reach the peak.
            \item At the end of the 15th day, Team $B$ decided to modify their plan, such that on each subsequent day, the vertical distance covered is 95\% of the vertical distance covered in the previous day. Which team will be the first to reach the peak of the mountain? Justify your answer.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            The vertical distance Team $A$ plans to cover in a day can be described as a sequence in arithmetic progression with first term 400 and common difference $-5$. In order to reach the peak, the total vertical distance covered by Team $A$ has to be greater than 8100 m. Hence,
            \[
                \dfrac{n}2 \bp{2 (400) + (n-1)(-5)} \geq 8100
            \]
            From the graphing calculator, $n \geq 24$. Hence, Team $A$ requires 24 days to reach the peak.

            \boxt{24 days.}

        \part
            The vertical distance Team $B$ plans to cover in the $n$th day can be described by the sequence $U_n$ in geometric progression with first term 800 and common ratio $r = 0.9$. Let $S^U_n$ be the $n$th partial sum of $U_n$. Since $\abs{r} < 1$, the sum to infinity of exists and is equal to
            \[
                S^U_\infty = \dfrac{800}{1 - 0.9} = 8000
            \]
            Hence, Team $B$ will never be able to surpass 8 km in height. Thus, they will not reach the peak no matter how long they take.

        \part
            The new vertical distance covered by Team $B$ after Day 15 can be described by the sequence $V_n$ in geometric progression with first term $U_{15}$ and common ratio $r = 0.95$. Let $S^V_n$ be the $n$th partial sum of $V_n$. Then,
            \[
                S^V_n = \frac{U_{15}\cdot 0.95 \bp{1 - (0.95)^n}}{1 - 0.95}
            \]
            Note that             
            \[
                S^U_n = \frac{800\bp{1 - (0.9)^n}}{1 - 0.9}
            \]
            Hence, after Day 15, Team $B$ has to climb another $8000 - S^U_{15} = 1747.13$ metres. Since $U_{15} = 183.01$, we have the inequality
            \[
                \frac{183.01\cdot0.95\bp{1 - (0.95)^n}}{1 - 0.95} \geq 1747.13
            \]
            Using the graphing calculator, $n \geq 14$. Hence, Team $B$ will need at least $15 + 14 = 29$ days to reach the peak.

            \boxt{Team $A$ will reach the peak first.}

    \problem{}
        The function $f$ is given by $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2 - e^{-x}$. It is known from graphical work that this equation has 2 roots $x = \a$ and $x = \b$, where $\a < \b$.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Show that $f(x) = 0$ has at least one root in the interval $[0, 1]$.
        \end{enumerate}

        It is known that there is exactly one root in $[0, 1]$ where $x = \a$.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \setcounter{enumi}{1}
            \item Starting with $x_0 = 0.5$, use an iterative method based on the form 
            \[
                x_{n+1} = p\bp{x_n^2 + q - e^{-x_n}}
            \]            
            where $p$ and $q$ are real numbers to be determined, to find the value of $\a$ correct to 3 decimal places. You should demonstrate that your answer has the required accuracy.
        \end{enumerate}

        It is known that the other root $x = \b$ lies in the interval $[2, 3]$.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \setcounter{enumi}{2}
            \item With the aid of a clearly labelled diagram, explain why the method in (b) will fail to obtain any reasonable approximation to $\b$, where $x_0$ is chosen such that $x_0 \in [2, 3]$, $x_0 \neq \b$.
        \end{enumerate}

        To obtain an approximation to $\b$, another approach is used.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \setcounter{enumi}{3}
            \item Use linear interpolation once in the interval $[2, 3]$ to find a first approximation to $\b$, giving your answer to 2 decimal places. Explain whether this approximate is an overestimate or underestimate.
            \item With your answer in (d) as the initial approximate, use the Newton-Raphson method to obtain $\b$ correct to 3 decimal places. Your process should terminate when you have two successive iterates that are equal when rounded to 3 decimal places.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            Observe that $f(0) = 1 > 0$ and $f(1) = -e^{-1} < 0$. Since $f$ is continuous and $f(0)f(1) < 0$, there must be at least one root to $f(x) = 0$ in the interval $[0, 1]$.

        \part
            Let $f(x) = 0$. Then,
            \begin{alignat*}{2}
                &&x^2 - 3x + 2 - e^{-x} &= 0\\
                \implies&&x^2 + 2 - e^{-x} &= 3x\\
                \implies&&x &= \dfrac13 \bp{x^2 + 2 - e^{-x}}
            \end{alignat*}
            Hence, we should use an iterative method based on the form
            \[
                x_{n+1} = \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_n + 2 - e^{-x_n}}
            \]
            Starting with $x_0 = 0.5$,
            \begin{alignat*}{3}
                && x_1 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_0 + 2 - e^{-x_0}} &= 0.54782\\

                \implies&&x_3 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_2 + 2 - e^{-x_2}} &= 0.58871\\
                \implies&&x_4 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_3 + 2 - e^{-x_3}} &= 0.59718\\
                \implies&&x_5 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_4 + 2 - e^{-x_4}} &= 0.60208\\
                \implies&&x_6 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_5 + 2 - e^{-x_5}} &= 0.60494\\
                \implies&&x_7 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_6 + 2 - e^{-x_6}} &= 0.60662\\
                \implies&&x_8 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_7 + 2 - e^{-x_7}} &= 0.60759\\
                \implies&&x_9 &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_8 + 2 - e^{-x_8}} &= 0.60817\\
                \implies&&x_{10} &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_9 + 2 - e^{-x_9}} &= 0.60851\\
                \implies&&x_{11} &= \dfrac13 \bp{ x^2_{10} + 2 - e^{-x_{10}}} &= 0.60870
            \end{alignat*}
            Since $f(0.6085) = 0.000606 > 0$ and $f(0.6095) = -0.000632 < 0$, we have that $\a \in (0.6085, 0.6095)$. Hence,
