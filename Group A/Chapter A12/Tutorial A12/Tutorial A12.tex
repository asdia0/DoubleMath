    \problem{}
        $A$ and $B$ are two independent events such that $\P{A} = 0.2$ and $\P{B} = 0.15$. Evaluate the following probabilities.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\P{A}{B}$,
            \item $\P{A \cap B}$,
            \item $\P{A \cup B}$.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            Since $A$ and $B$ are independent, $\P{A}{B} = \P{A} = \boxed{0.2}$.

        \part
            Since $A$ and $B$ are independent, $\P{A \cap B} = \P{A}\P{B} = 0.2 \cdot 0.15 = \boxed{0.03}$.
        
        \part
            $\P{A \cup B} = \P{A} + \P{B} - \P{A \cap B} = 0.2 + 0.15 - 0.03 = \boxed{0.32}$.

    \problem{}
        Two events $A$ and $B$ are such that $\P{A} = \dfrac{8}{15}$, $\P{B} = \dfrac{1}{3}$ and $\P{A}{B} = \dfrac15$. Calculate the probabilities that
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item both events occur,
            \item only one of the two events occurs,
            \item neither event occurs.
        \end{enumerate}
        Determine if event $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive or independent.

    \solution
        \part
            $\P{A \cap B} = \P{B} \P{A}{B} = \dfrac13 \cdot \dfrac15 = \boxed{\dfrac1{15}}$.

        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{\text{only one occurs}} &= \P{\text{at least one occurs}) - \P(\text{both occur}}\\
                &= \P{A \cup B} - \P{A \cap B}\\
                &= \P{A} + \P{B} - \P{A \cap B} - \P{A \cap B}\\
                &= \dfrac8{15} + \dfrac13 - 2 \cdot \dfrac1{15}\\
                &= \boxed{\dfrac{11}{15}}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            $\P{\text{neither occurs}} = 1 - \P{\text{at least one occurs}} = 1 - \bp{\dfrac1{15} - \dfrac{11}{15}} = \boxed{\dfrac15}$.

    \problem{}
        Two events $A$ and $B$ are such that $\P{A} = \P{B} = p$ and $\P{A \cup B} = \dfrac59$.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given that $A$ and $B$ are independent, find a quadratic equations satisfied by $p$.
            \item Hence find the value of $p$ and the value of $\P{A \cap B}$.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            Since $A$ and $B$ are independent, we have $\P{A}{B} = \P{A} = p$.
            \begin{alignat*}{2}
                && p &= \P{A}{B}\\
                && &= \dfrac{\P{A \cap B}}{\P{B}}\\
                && &= \dfrac{\P{A} + \P{B} - \P{A \cup B}}{\P{B}}\\
                && &= \dfrac{p + p - 5/9}{p}\\
                && &= 2 - \dfrac{5}{9p}\\
                \implies&& 9p^2 &= 18p - 5\\
                \implies&& 9p^2 - 18p + 5 &= 0
            \end{alignat*}

            \boxt{$p$ satisfies the quadratic equation $9p^2 - 18p + 5 = 0$.}

        \part
            Observe that $9p^2 - 18p + 5 = (3p - 1)(3p - 5)$.  Thus, $\boxed{p = \dfrac13}$. Note that $p \neq \dfrac53$ since $0 < p \leq 1$.

            Since $A$ and $B$ are independent, $\P{A \cap B} = \P{A} \P{B} = \dfrac13 \cdot \dfrac13 = \boxed{\dfrac19}$.

    \problem{}
        Two players $A$ and $B$ regularly play each other at chess. When $A$ has the first move in a game, the probability of $A$ winning that game is $0.4$ and the probability of $B$ winning that game is $0.2$. When $B$ has the first move in a game, the probability of $B$ winning that game is $0.3$ and the probability of $A$ winning that game is $0.2$. Any game of chess that is not won by either player ends in a draw.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given that $A$ and $B$ toss a fair coin to decide who has the first move in a game, find the probability of the game ending in a draw.
            \item To make their games more enjoyable, $A$ and $B$ agree to change the procedure for deciding who has the first move in a game. As a result of their new procedure, the probability of $A$ having the first move in any game is $p$. Find the value of $p$ which gives $A$ and $B$ equal chances of winning each game.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{\text{draw}} &= \P{\text{$A$ first}}\P{\text{draw}}{\text{$A$ first}} + \P{\text{$B$ first}}\P{\text{draw}}{\text{$B$ first}}\\
                &= 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.4 - 0.2) + 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.3 - 0.2)\\
                &= \boxed{0.45}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            \begin{alignat*}{2}
                && \P{\text{$A$ wins}} &= \P{\text{$A$ first}}\P{\text{$A$ wins}}{\text{$A$ first}} + \P{\text{$B$ first}}\P{\text{$A$ wins}}{\text{$B$ first}}\\
                && &= p \cdot 0.4 + (1-p) \cdot 0.2\\
                && &= 0.2p + 0.2\\
                && \P{\text{$B$ wins}} &= \P{\text{$A$ first}}\P{\text{$B$ wins}}{\text{$A$ first}} + \P{\text{$B$ first}}\P{\text{$B$ wins}}{\text{$B$ first}}\\
                && &= p \cdot 0.2 + (1-p) \cdot 0.3\\
                && &= -0.1p + 0.3
            \end{alignat*}
            Consider $\P{\text{$A$ wins}} = \P{\text{$B$ wins}}$. Then $0.2p + 0.2 = -0.1p + 0.3 \implies \boxed{p = \dfrac13}$.

    \problem{}
        Two fair dices are thrown, and events $A$, $B$ and $C$ are defined as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $A$: the sum of the two scores is odd,
            \item $B$: at least one of the two scores is greater than 4,
            \item $C$: the two scores are equal.
        \end{itemize}
        Find, showing your reasons clearly in each case, which two of these three events are
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item mutually exclusive,
            \item independent.
        \end{enumerate}
        Find also $\P{C}{B}$, making your method clear.

    \solution
        \part
            Let the scores of the first and second die be $p$ and $q$ respectively. Suppose $A$ occurs. Then $p$ and $q$ are of different parities (e.g. $p$ even $\implies$ $q$ odd). Thus, $p$ and $q$ cannot be equal. Hence, $C$ cannot occur.
            \boxt{$A$ and $C$ are mutually exclusive.}

        \part
            Let the scores of the first and second die be $p$ and $q$ respectively. Observe that $p$ is independent of $q$, and vice versa. Hence, the parity of $q$ is not affected by the parity of $p$. Thus, $\P{A} = \P{\text{$p$ even}}\P{\text{$q$ odd}} + \P{\text{$p$ odd}}\P{\text{$q$ even}} = \dfrac36 \cdot \dfrac36 + \dfrac36 \cdot \dfrac36 = \dfrac12$.

            We also have $\P{B} = 1 - \P{\text{neither $p$ nor $q$ is greater than 4}} = 1 - \bp{\dfrac46}^2 = \dfrac{20}{36}$.

            We now consider $\P(A \cap B)$. From the table of outcomes above, it is clear that $\P(A \cap B) = \dfrac{10}{36} = \P{A}\P{B}$.
            \boxt{$A$ and $B$ are independent.}

    \problem{}
        For events $A$ and $B$, it is given that $\P{A} = 0.7$, $\P{B} = 0.6$ and $\P{A}{B'} = 0.8$. Find
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\P{A \cap B'}$,
            \item $\P{A \cup B}$,
            \item $\P{B'}{A}$.
        \end{enumerate}
        For a third event $C$, it is given that $\P{C} = 0.5$ and that $A$ and $C$ are independent.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \setcounter{enumi}{3}
            \item Find $\P{A' \cap C}$.
            \item Hence find an inequality satisfied by $\P{A' \cap B \cap C}$ in the form \[p \leq \P{A' \cap B \cap C} \leq q,\] where $p$ and $q$ are constants to be determined.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            $\P{A \cap B'} = \P{B'} \P{A}{B'} = (1-0.6) \cdot 0.8 = \boxed{0.32}$.

        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{A \cup B} &= \P{A} + \P{B} - \P{A \cap B}\\
                &= \P{A} + \P{B} - \bs{\P{A} - \P{A \cap B'}}\\
                &= 0.7 + 0.6 - (0.7 - 0.32)\\
                &= \boxed{0.92}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{B'}{A} &= \dfrac{\P{B' \cap A}}{\P{A}}\\
                &= \dfrac{0.32}{0.7}\\
                &= \boxed{\dfrac{16}{35}}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            Since $A$ and $C$ are independent, $\P{A \cap C} = \P{A} \P{C}$. Hence, $\P{A' \cap C} = \P{C} - \P{A \cap C} = 0.5 - 0.7 \cdot 0.5 = \boxed{0.15}$.

        \part
            Consider the following Venn diagram.
            \begin{center}

                    \node[above] at (0,2/1.3+2) {$C$};

                    \node at (-3, 3) {$a$};

                    \node at (1, 0.8) {$g$};
                    \node at (0, 0.25) {$h$};
                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            Note that $\P{A' \cap B \cap C} = g$. From part (d), we have $b + g = \P{A' \cap C} = 0.15$. Hence, $g \leq 0.15$. From part (b), we have $a + b = 1 - \P{A \cup B} = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$. Hence, $b \leq 0.08 \implies g \geq 0.07$.

            Thus, $0.07 \leq g \leq 0.15$, whence \boxt{$0.07 \leq \P{A' \cap B \cap C} \leq 0.15$}

    \problem{}
        In a probability experiment, three containers have the following contents.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A jar contains 2 white dice and 3 black dice.
            \item A white box contains 5 red balls and 3 green balls.
            \item A black box contains 4 red balls and 3 green balls.
        \end{itemize}
        One die is taken at random from the jar. If the die is white, two balls are taken from the white box, at random and without replacement. If the die is black, two balls are taken from the black box, at random and without replacement. Events $W$ and $M$ are defined as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $W$: A white die is taken from the jar.
            \item $M$: One red ball and one green ball are obtained.
        \end{itemize}
        Show that $\P{M}{W} = \dfrac{15}{28}$.

        Find, giving each of your answers as an exact fraction in its lowest terms,
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\P{M \cap W}$,
            \item $\P{W}{M}$,
            \item $\P{W \cup M}$.
        \end{enumerate}

        All the dice and balls are now placed in a single container, and four objects are taken at random, each object being replaced before the next one is taken. Find the probability that one object of each colour is obtained.

    \solution
        Since $W$ has occured, both red and green balls must come from the white box. Note that there are two ways for $M$ to occur: first a red then a green, or first a green then a red. Hence, $\P{M}{W} = \dfrac58 \cdot \dfrac37 + \dfrac38 \cdot \dfrac57 = \dfrac{15}{28}$ as desired.
        
        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{M \cup W} &= \P{W} \P{M}{W}\\
                &= \dfrac25 \cdot \dfrac{15}{28}\\
                &= \dfrac{3}{14}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            Let $B$ represent the event that a black die is taken from the jar. Then 
            \begin{align*}
                \P{M} &= \P{M \cap W} + \P{M \cap B}\\
                &= \P{M \cap W} + \P{B} \P{M}{B}\\
                &= \dfrac{3}{14} + \dfrac35 \bp{\dfrac47\cdot\dfrac36 + \dfrac37\cdot\dfrac46}\\
                &= \dfrac{39}{70}
            \end{align*}
            Hence, $\P{W}{M} = \dfrac{\P{W \cap M}}{\P{M}} = \dfrac{3/14}{39/70} = \boxed{\dfrac5{13}}$.
        
        \part
            \begin{align*}
                \P{W \cup M} &= \P{W} + \P{M} - \P{W \cap M}\\
                &= \dfrac25 + \dfrac{39}{70} - \dfrac{3}{14}\\
                &= \boxed{\dfrac{26}{35}}
            \end{align*}

        \dash
        Note that the container has 2 white objects, 3 black objects, 9 red objects and 6 green objects, for a total of 20 objects. The probability that one object of each colour is taken is thus given by \[\dfrac2{20} \cdot \dfrac{3}{20} \cdot \dfrac9{20} \cdot \dfrac6{20} \cdot 4! = \boxed{\dfrac{243}{5000}}.\]

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the probability that the letter to $A$ is in the correct envelope and the letter to $B$ is in an incorrect envelope.
            \item Find the probability that the letter to $A$ is in the correct envelope, given that the letter to $B$ is in an incorrect envelope.

            \item at least one counter of each colour is drawn,

                &= 1 - \dfrac1{14} - \dfrac1{210}\\
                &= \boxed{\dfrac{97}{105}}

        Since $\P{\text{at least 2 green}} = \dfrac{37}{42} \neq \dfrac{85}{97} = \P{\text{at least 2 green}}{\text{one of each colour}}$, the two events are not independent.

        A group of fifteen people consists of one pair of sisters, one set of three brothers and ten other people. The fifteen people are arranged randomly in a line.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the probability that the sisters are next to each other.
            \item Find the probability that the brother are not all next to one another.
            \item Find the probability that either the sisters are next to each other or the brothers are all next to one another or both.
            \item Find the probability that the sisters are next to each other given that the brothers are not all next to one another.
        \end{enumerate}

    \solution
        \part
            Let the two sisters be one unit. There are hence 14 units altogether, giving $14! \cdot 2!$ arrangements with the restriction. Since there are a total of $15!$ arrangements without the restriction, the required probability is $\dfrac{14! \cdot 2!}{15!} = \boxed{\dfrac{2}{15}}$.

        \part
            Consider the case where all brothers are next to one another. Counting the brothers as one uint gives 13 units altogether. There are hence $13! \cdot 3!$ arrangements with this restriction. Since there are a total of $15!$ arrangements without the restriction, the probability that all three brothers are not together is given by $\dfrac{13! \cdot 3!}{15!} = \boxed{\dfrac{34}{35}}$.

        \part
            Consider the case where both the sisters are adjacent and all three brothers are next to one another. Counting the sisters as one unit, and counting the brothers as one unit gives 12 units altogether. There are hence $12! \cdot 2! \cdot 3!$ arrangements with this restriction. Since there are a total of $15!$ arrangements without the restriction, we have
            \begin{align*}
                \P{\text{sisters together $\cap$ brothers together}} &= \dfrac{12! \cdot 2! \cdot 3!}{15!}\\
                &= \dfrac2{455}
            \end{align*}
            Hence, 
            \begin{align*}
                &\P{\text{sisters together $\cup$ brothers together}} \\
                &= \P{\text{sisters together}} + \P{\text{brothers together}} - \P{\text{sisters together $\cap$ brothers together}}\\

                &= \boxed{\dfrac{43}{273}}
            \end{align*}

        \part
            Note that
            \begin{align*}
                &\P{\text{sisters together $\cap$ brothers not together}}\\
                &\hspace{3em}= \P{\text{sisters together}} - \P{\text{sisters together $\cap$ brothers together}}\\

            Hence, the required probability can be calculated as
            \begin{align*}
                &\P{\text{sisters together}}{\text{brothers not together}}\\
                &\hspace{3em}= \dfrac{\P{\text{sisters together $\cap$ brothers not together}}}{\P{\text{brothers not together}}}\\
