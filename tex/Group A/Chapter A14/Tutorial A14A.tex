\begin{problem}
    Alfred and Bertie play a game, each starting with cash amounting to \$100. Two dice are thrown. If the total score if 5 or more, then Alfred pays \$$x$, where $0 < x \leq 8$, to Bertie. If the total score if 4 or less, then Bertie pays \$$(x+8)$ to Alfred.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the expectation of Alfred's cash after the first game is \$$\frac13 (304 - 2x)$.
        \item Find the expectation of Alfred's cash after six games.
        \item Find the value of $x$ for the game to be fair.
        \item Given that $x = 3$, find the variance of Alfred's cash after the first game.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        Note that \[\P{\text{score}<5} = \frac{3 + 2 + 1}{6^2} = \frac16 \implies \P{\text{score} \geq 5} = 1 - \frac16 = \frac56.\] Let \$$a_n$ be the expectation of Alfred's cash after $n$ games. Suppose Alfred and Bertie play one more game (i.e. $n + 1$ total games). Then \[a_{n+1} = \frac56 (a_n - x) + \frac16(a_n + x + 8) = a_n + \frac23 \bp{2-x}.\] $a_n$ is in AP with common difference $\frac23 \bp{2-x}$ and is thus given by \[a_n = a_0 + n\bs{\frac23 \bp{2-x}} = 100 + \frac{2n}{3}(2-x).\] Hence, the expectation of Alfred's cash after the first game is \[a_1 = 100 + \frac{2 \cdot 1}3(2 - x) = \frac13(304 - 2x).\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        The expectation of Alfred's cash after six games is \[a_6 = 100 + \frac{2 \cdot 6}{3}(2 - x) = 108 - 4x.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        For the game to be fair, $a_0 = a_1 = a_2 = \cdots$, i.e. the common difference is 0. Hence, $x = 2$.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Let the random variable $X$ be Alfred's cash after one game. Since the payouts are unaffected by $a_0$, we take $a_0 = 0$. When $x = 3$, $\E(X) = -\frac23$. Hence, \[\Var{X} = \frac56 \bp{3 - \frac23}^2 + \frac16 \bp{3 + 8 + \frac23}^2 = \frac{245}{9}.\]
    \end{ppart}
\end{solution}
