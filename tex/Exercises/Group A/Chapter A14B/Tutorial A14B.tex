\begin{problem}
    Every student in Sunny Junior College owns a graphic calculator (GC). The probability of a student carrying a GC to school is $0.98$. Assume that the number of students who carries a GC to school follows a binomial distribution.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \begin{enumerate}
            \item Given that the probability that more than $m$ students, in a random sample of 30 students, carry a GC to school is at most $0.99$, find the least value of $m$.
            \item Give a reason why in real life, the number of students who carries a GC to school may not follow a binomial distribution.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{1}
        \item Find the probability that the 15th student who reports to Mr Ng is the 9th student whose GC has the latest OS while the last student is the 10th student without the latest OS.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    In a computer game, a bug moves from left to right through a network of connected paths. The bug starts at $S$ and, at each junction, randomly takes the left fork with probability $p$ or the right fork with probability $q$, where $q = 1-p$. The forks taken at each junction are independent. The bug finishes its journey at one of the 9 endpoints labelled A{\textendash}I (see diagram).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the probability that the bug finishes its journey at D is $56p^5 q^3$.
        \item Given that the probability that the bug finishes its journey at D is greater than the probability at any one of the other endpoints, find exactly the possible range of values of $p$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In another version of the game, the probability that, at each junction, the bug takes the left fork is $0.9p$, the probability that the bug takes the right fork is $0.9q$ and the probability that the bug is swallowed up by a `black hole' is $0.1$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{2}
        \item Find the probability that, in this version of the game, the bug reaches one of the endpoints A{\textendash}I, without being swallowed up by a black hole.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{ppart}
        Relabel each endpoint from A{\textendash}I to 0{\textendash}8. Let the random variable $X$ be the end-point that the bug ends up at. Clearly, to reach endpoint $i$, the bug must take $i$ right forks and $8-i$ left forks. Hence, $X \sim \Binom{8}{q}$ and the probability that the bug reaches endpoint 3 (i.e. endpoint D) is \[\P{X = 3} = \binom{8}{3} q^3 (1-q)^{8-3} = 56p^5q^3.\]
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Since $X$ follows a binomial distribution, it suffices to find the range of values of $p$ that satisfy $\P{X = 2} < \P{X = 3} > \P{X = 4}$.
        
        \case{1}[$\P{X = 2} < \P{X = 3}$] Note that $\P(X = 2) = \binom{8}{2} q^2 (1-q)^{8-2} = 28p^6q^2$. \[\P(X = 2) < \P(X = 3) \implies 28p^6q^2 < 56p^5q^3 \implies 28p < 56(1-p) \implies p < \frac23.\]

        \case{2}[$\P{X = 3} > \P{X = 4}$] Note that $\P{X = 4} = \binom{8}{4} q^4 (1 - q)^{8-4} = 70 p^4 q^4$. \[\P(X = 3) > \P(X = 4) \implies 56p^5q^3 > 70p^4q^4 \implies 56p > 70(1-p) \implies p > \frac59.\]

        Hence, $\frac59 < p < \frac23$.
    \end{ppart}
    \begin{ppart}
        Note that the bug most take a total of 8 forks. Since the probability of not getting swallowed by a black hole at each fork is $0.9$, the desired probability is clearly $0.9^8 = 0.430 \tosf{3}$.
    \end{ppart}
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    The number of injuries, $X$, sustained by workers in a factory per week follows a Poisson distribution with standard deviation $\s$. Given that $3\P{X = 2} = 16\P{X = 4}$ determine the value of $\s$ and hence state the mean of $X$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the probability that, in a randomly chosen week, there is at least one injury.
        \item Assuming that a month consists of four weeks, find the probability that, in a randomly chosen month, there are less than 4 injuries.
        \item Calculate the probability that there will be more than 1 but less than 4 injuries in each of two consecutive weeks.

        \item that there will be no lorries passing $P$ in a given 10-min period,
        \item that at least one lorry from each direction will pass $P$ in a given 10-minute period,
        \item more than 2 westward travelling lorries will pass $P$ between the time 1410 and 1445,
        \item that there will be exactly 4 lorries passing $P$ in a given 20-minutes period
        \item at least 2 eastward travelling lorries passing $P$ in a period of 20 minutes given that there are exactly 4 lorries passing P at that time.
    \end{enumerate}
