\begin{problem}
    A group of student representatives is to be chosen from three schools, $R$, $S$ and $T$. The group is to consist of 10 students and is chosen from a set of 15 students consisting of 3 from $R$, 4 from $S$ and 8 from $T$. Find the probability that the group consists of
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item students from $S$ and $T$ only,

\begin{problem}
    A box contains 25 apples, of which 20 are red and 5 are green. Of the red apples, 3 contain maggots and of the green apples, 1 contains maggots. Two apples are chosen at random from the box. Find, in any order,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item the probability that both apples contain maggots.
        \item the probability that both apples are red and at least one contains maggots.
        \item the probability that at least one apple contains maggots, given that both apples are red.

\begin{problem}
    A bag contains 15 tokens that are indistinguishable apart from their colours. 2 of the tokens are blue and the rest are either red or green. Participants are required to draw the tokens randomly, one at a time, from the bag without replacement.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Given that the probability that a participant draws 2 red tokens on the first 2 draws is $1/35$, show that there are 3 red tokens in the bag.
        \item Find the probability that a participant draws a red or green token on the second draw.
    \end{enumerate}

    Events $A$ and $B$ are defined as follows.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $A$: A participant draws his/her second red token on the third draw.
        \item $B$: A participant draws a blue token on the second draw.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{2}

    A group of students is asked whether they own any of a laptop, a tablet and a games machine. The numbers owning different combinations are shown in the Venn diagram. The number of students owning none of these is $x$. One of the students is chosen at random.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $L$ is the event that the student owns a laptop.
        \item $T$ is the event that the student owns a tablet.
        \item $G$ is the event that the student owns a game machine.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Write down expressions for $\P{L}$ and $\P{G}$ in terms of $x$. Given that $L$ and $G$ are independent, show that $x = 10$.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    A group of students takes an examination in Science. A student who fails the examination at the first attempt is allowed one further attempt. For a randomly chosen student, the probability of passing the examination at the first attempt is $p$. If the student fails the examination at the first attempt, the probability of passing at the second attempt is $0.3$ more than the probability of passing the examination at the first attempt.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the probability that a randomly chosen student passes the examination is $0.3 + 1.7p - p^2$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Find the value of $p$ such that the probability that a randomly chosen student passes the examination on the first attempt given that the student passes is $0.6$.

    Two students are randomly chosen.

\begin{problem}[\chili]
    A fast food restaurant gives away a free action figure for every child's meal bought. There are five different action figures and each figure is equally likely to be given away with a child's meal. A customer intends to collect all five different figures by buying child's meals.

        \item Find the probability that the first 4 child's meals bought by the customer all had different action figures.
        \item Two of the five action figures are X and Y. Find the probability that the first 4 action figures obtained result in the customer having at least one X or one Y or both.
        \item Find the probability that the first 4 child's meals bought by the customer had exactly two different action figures.
        \item At a certain stage, the customer collected 4 of the five action figures. Given that the probability of the customer completing the set by at most $n$ meals is larger than 0.95, find the least value of $n$.
