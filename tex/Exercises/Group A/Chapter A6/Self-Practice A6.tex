\begin{problem}
    A curve $C$ has equation, in polar coordinates, $r = a\sqrt{\bp{4 + \sin^2 \t} \cos \t}$, $-\frac12 \pi \leq \t \leq \frac12 \pi$, where $a$ is a positive constant.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that $\der{}{\t} \bs{\bp{4 + \sin^2 \t}\cos\t} = -\bp{2 + 3\sin^2 \t} \sin \t$. Hence, state, with a reason, whether $r$ increases or decreases as $\t$ increases, for $0 < \t \leq \frac12 \pi$.
        \item Sketch the curve $C$.
        \item Find the Cartesian equation of $C$ in the form $\bp{x^2 + y^2}^m = a^2 x \bp{bx^2 + cy^2}$, giving the numerical values of $m$, $b$ and $c$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Explain briefly about how you can tell from this form of the equation that $C$ is symmetrical about the line $\t = 0$ and that the tangent to $C$ at the pole $O$ is perpendicular to the line $\t = 0$.
        \item Show that the equation of $C$ in Cartesian coordinates may be expressed in the form $y^2 = a^{2/3} x^{4/3} - x^2$.

\begin{problem}
    The equation of curve $C$ is given in polar coordinates by $r = 1 + \sin 2\t$, $0 \leq \t \leq 2\pi$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that $C$ is symmetric about the pole.
        \item Sketch $C$ and any tangents to $C$ at the pole. Label any points of intersection with the axes, and show clearly the symmetries and curvature near the pole.
        \item Determine whether each loop of $C$ is a circle. Justify your answer.
        \item Show that the Cartesian equation of $C$ is $\bp{x^2 + y^2}^3 = (x+y)^4$.
