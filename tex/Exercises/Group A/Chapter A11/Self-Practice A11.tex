\begin{problem}
    A panel of judges in an essay competition has to select, and place in order of merit, 4 winning entries from a total entry of 20. Find the number of ways in which this can be done.

    As a first step in the selection, 5 finalists are selected, without being placed in order. Find the number of ways in which this can be done.
    
    All 20 essays are subsequently assessed by three panels of judges for content, accuracy and style, respectively, and three special prizes are awarded, one by each panel. Find the number of ways in which this can be done, assuming that an essay may win more than one prize.

\begin{problem}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A bookcase has four shelves with ten books on each shelf. Find the number of different selections that can be made by taking two books from each shelf (i.e. 8 books in all). Find also the number of different selections that can be made by taking eight books from each shelf (i.e. 32 books in all.)
        \item Eight cards each have a single digit written on them. The digits are 2, 2, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7 respectively. Find the number of different 7-digit numbers that can be formed by placing seven of the cards side by side.

\begin{problem}
    A team in a particular sport consists of 1 goalkeeper, 4 defenders, 2 midfielders and 4 attackers. A certain club has 3 goalkeepers, 8 defenders, 5 midfielders and 6 attackers.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How many different teams can be formed by the club?
    \end{enumerate}

    One of the midfielders in the club is the brother of one of the attackers in the club.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{1}
        \item How many different teams can be formed which include exactly one of the two brothers?
    \end{enumerate}

    The two brothers leave the club. The club manager decides that one of the remaining midfielders can play either as a midfielder or a defender.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \setcounter{enumi}{2}
        \item How many different teams can now be formed by the club?
    \end{enumerate}

            \item Find the number of different possible orders.
            \item Find the number of different possible orders in which each man stands next to his wife.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item The group stands in a circle.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the number of different possible arrangements.

\begin{problem}[\chili]
    A delegation of four students is to be selected from five badminton players, $m$ floorball players, where $m > 3$, and six swimmers to attend the opening ceremony of the 2017 National Games. A pair of twins is among the floorball players. The delegation is to consist of at least one player from each sport.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that the number of ways to select the delegation in which neither of the twins is selected is $k(m-2)(m+6)$, where $k$ is an integer to be determined.
        \item Given that the number of ways to select a delegation in which neither of the twins is selected is more than twice the number of ways to select a delegation which includes exactly one of the twins, find the least value of $m$.
    \end{enumerate}

    The pair of twins, one badminton player, one swimmer and two teachers, have been selected to attend a welcome lunch at the opening ceremony. Find the number of ways in which the group can be seated at a round table with distinguishable seats if the pair of twins is to be seated together and the teachers are separated.
