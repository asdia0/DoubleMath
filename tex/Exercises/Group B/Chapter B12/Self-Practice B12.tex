\begin{problem}
    Show that the differential equation $x^2 \der{y}{x} - 2xy + 3 = 0$ may be reduced by means of the substitution $y = ux^2$ to $\der{u}{x} = -\frac3{x^4}$. Hence, other otherwise, show that the general solution for $y$ in terms of $x$ is $y = Cx^2 + \frac1x$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Use the substitution $z = y \e^x$ to find the general solution of the differential equation $\der{y}{x} + y = 2x + 3$. Sketch on one diagram, the curve of a particular solution for which $y \to \infty$ as $x \to -\infty$, labelling the equation of this particular solution.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the general solution of the differential equation \[\der{y}{x} = (x+2)(y-3),\] giving your answer in the form $y = f(x)$.
        \item Given that $u$ and $t$ are related by \[\der{u}{t} = 16 - 9u^2,\] and that $u = 1$ when $t = 0$, find $t$ in terms of $u$, simplifying your answer.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    At each instant of time the rate of increase of money in a savings account is proportional to the amount in the account at that instant. The constant of proportionality does not vary with time. Denote the amount in the account at time $t$ years by \$$x$. When $x = 1000$, the rate of increase is \$50 per year. Obtain a differential equation relating $x$ and $t$. 
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Initially, when $t = 0$, the account contained \$900. Find the amount in the account exactly 3 years later.
        \item Find, in years correct to 2 places of decimals, the time when the account contains \$1800.
        \item Comment on whether the model can be regarded as a good model of the situation in the real world.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    Salt is dissolved in a tank filled with 120 litres of water. Salt water containing 20 g of salt per litre is poured in at a rate of 3 litres per minute and the mixture flows out at a constant rate of 3 litres per minute. The contents of the tank are kept well mixed at all times. Let the amount of salt in the tank (in grams) be denoted by $S$ and the time (in minutes) be denoted by $t$. 

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that $\der{S}{t} = \frac{2400-S}{40}$.
        \item Given that 400g of salt was dissolved in the tank initially, find the amount of salt in the tank after 1 hour, giving your answer to the nearest grams. 
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
    In a certain country, the price of a brand-new car of a particular make, manufactured on 1 January 1996, is \$32,000. According to a model of car pricing, the price $P$ of the car (in \$) depreciates at a rate proportional to $P$ when the car is $t$ years old (as from 1 January 1996). Write down a differential equation relating $P$ and $t$.
    
    By solving this differential equation, show that $P = 32000\e^{-kt}$ where $k$ is a positive constant.
    
    A man purchased a used car of this particular make for \$2000, at the price predicted by the model, on 1 January 2006. Subsequently on 1 January 2007, the man sold the used car for \$800. Determine if the man sold his car below the price predicted by the model.
