\begin{problem}
    Express $\frac{6x+4}{(1-2x)(1+3x^{2})}$ in partial fractions. Hence, find the coefficients of $x^{5}$ and $x^{6}$ in the expansion, in ascending powers of $x$, of $\frac{6x+4}{(1-2x)(1+3x^{2})}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    If $x$ is so small that terms in $x^n$, $n \geq 3$, can be neglected and $\frac{3+ax}{3+bx}=(1-x)^{1/3}$, find the values of $a$ and $b$. Hence, find an approximation for $\sqrt[3]{0.96}$ in the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Given that $y=\tan{\frac12 \arctan x}$, show that \[\bp{1 + x^2} \der{y}{x} = \frac12 \bp{1 + y^2}.\] By differentiating this result twice, show that, up to and including the term in $x^{3}$, the Maclaurin series for $\tan{\frac12 \arctan x}$ is $\frac12x - \frac18 x^3$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Given that $\cos y=\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{4} \e^x}$ and $0<y<\frac{\pi}{2}$, show that $\sin 2y \der{y}{x} = \frac14 \e^x$. By further differentiation of this result, find the Maclaurin series for $y$, up to and including the term in $x^{2}$, leaving your answer in exact form. Deduce the equation of the tangent to the curve $y=\arccos \sqrt{1-\frac{1}{4} \e^x}$ at $x=0$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    By expressing $\sin{\frac\pi3 + 2x}$ in terms of $\sin2x$ and $\cos2x$, show that \[\sin{\frac\pi3 + 2x} \approx \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + x - \sqrt{3}x^2\] if $x$ is sufficiently small. Hence, by using a suitable value of $x$, estimate the value of $\sin\frac{\pi}{9}$, giving your answer to 3 significant figures.

\begin{problem}[\chili]
    Consider the infinite series $\frac{1}{1!}+\frac{4}{2!}+\frac{7}{3!}+\frac{10}{4!}+\dots$.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the series continues with the same pattern, find an expression for the $n$th term.
        \item By rewriting the infinite series in terms of sigma notation and using the standard series for $\e^{x}$, show that the series evaluates to $\e+2$.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[\chili]
    Find the function represented by each of the following series by expressing it as a sum or difference of two standard series.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $f(x) = 2+x+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{2x^{4}}{4!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}+\frac{x^{7}}{7!}+\frac{2x^{3}}{8!}+\dots$, $x\in\RR$.
        \item $g(x)= (a+b)x-\frac{a^{2}+b^{2}}{2}x^{2}+\frac{a^{3}+b^{3}}{3}x^3 - \frac{a^4 + b^4}4 x^4 + \dots$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants such that $-\frac1a < x \leq \frac1a$ and $-\frac1b < x \leq \frac1b$.
    \end{enumerate}
