\begin{problem}
    At what rate is the area of a rectangle changing if its length is 15 units and increasing at 3 units/s while its width is 6 units and increasing at 2 units/s?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    A particle moving along ametal plate in the $xy$-plane has the velocity $\vec v = \vec i - 4 \vec j$ cm/s at the point $(3, 2)$. If the temperature of the plate at points in the $xy$-plane is $T(x, y) = y^2 \ln x$ where $x \geq 1$, in degrees Celsius, find $\derx{T}{t}$ at $(3, 2)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Given that $f(x, y) = x^2 \e^y$, find the maximum value of a directional derivative at $(-2, 0)$ and give a unit vector in the direction in which the maximum value occurs.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    If the electric potential at a point $(x, y)$ in the $xy$-plane is $V(x, y)$, where $V(x, y) = \e^{-2x} \cos 2y$, find the direction where $V$ decreases most rapidly at $(0, \pi/6)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Find all local extrema and saddle points of $f(x, y) = 4xy - x^4 - y^4$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Find the absolute extrema of $f(x, y) = x^2 + 2y^2 - x$ such that the domain of this function $f$ is the circular region $x^2 + y^2 \leq 4$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    A length of sheet metal 27 cm wide is to be made into a water trough by bending up two sides as shown in the figure below. Find the values of $x$ and $\t$ such that the trapezoid-shaped cross-section has a maximum area.

            \coordinate (A) at (3, 0);

\begin{problem}
    A Further Math student smiled when a question asked for him to find the quadratic approximation for the function of $f(x, y) = xy - 3y - x$ around the point $(2, 3)$. Explain why he is so delighted.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    The function $f(x, y) = xy - 3y - x$ is already a quadratic, hence the quadratic approximation to $f(x, y)$ is simply $f(x, y)$ itself.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
    A company produces two products, $A$ and $B$, which require different amounts of two resources, Resource 1 and Resource 2. The profit generated by selling product $A$ is \$10 per unit, and the profit from selling product $B$ is \$15 per unit. Each unit of product $A$ requires 2 units of Resource 1 and 1 unit of Resource 2. Each unit of product $B$ requries 1 unit of Resource 1 and 3 units of Resource 2. The company has a total of 100 units of Resource 1 and 90 units of Resource 2. What should the company produce in order to maximize its profitability?
