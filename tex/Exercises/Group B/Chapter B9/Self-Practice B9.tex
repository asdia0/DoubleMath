\begin{problem}
    A curve is defined parametrically by $\ x=2\sqrt{2}a\sin\t$, $y=\frac{1}{2}a\sin2\t$.

\begin{problem}
    A curve is defined parametrically by $x=t^{2}-2\ln t$, $y=4(t-1)$, where $t\in\RR$, $t\geq1$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The points $A$ and $B$ on the curve are given by $t=1$ and $t=2$ respectively. Show that the length of the arc $AB$ of the curve is $3+2\ln2$.
        \item The arc $AB$ is rotated through one revolution about the $x$-axis. Show that the area of the curved surface generated is $\frac83 \pi (11 - 6\ln2)$.

\begin{problem}
    The curve $\G$ has polar equation $r=ke^{\t}$, where $k$ is a positive constant and $0\leq\t\leq\pi$. The points $P$ and $Q$ on $\G$ correspond to $\t=\a$ and $\t=\b$ respectively ($\b > \a$). The area of the region bounded by the lines $\t=\a$, $\t=\b$ and the arc $PQ$ is denoted by $A$. The length of the arc $PQ$ is denoted by $s$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find expressions for $A$ and $s$ in terms of $\a,\b$ and $k$.
        \item Deduce that \[\frac{A}{s^2} = \frac18 \bp{\frac{\e^\b + \e^a}{\e^b - \e^a}}.\]
