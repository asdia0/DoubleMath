\chapter*{Preface}

\section*{About this Book}

This book is a collection of notes and exercises based on the 2025 H2 Mathematics (9758) and H2 Further Mathematics (9649) syllabi for the Singapore-Cambridge A-Level examinations.

\section*{Notation}

All definitions, resuls, methods and examples are colour-coded green, blue, purple and red respectively. 

Challenging exercises are marked with a ``\chili'' symbol.

The area of a polygon $A_1 A_2 \dots A_n$ is notated $[A_1 A_2 \dots A_n]$. In particular the area of a triangle $ABC$ is notated $[\triangle ABC]$.

For formatting reasons, an inline column vector is notated as $\cveciiix{x}{y}{z}$.

$\exp x$ is equivalent to $\e^{x}$. This is only really used when $x$ is some gnarly expression.
