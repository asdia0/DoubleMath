### Scripts 

### [`numberLine.py`](.meta/numberLine.py)

Generates the $\LaTeX$ code for the number line of a given polynomial.

### [`plot.py`](.meta/plot.py)

Calculates all points of interest given a system of equations. Points of interest include:

- $x$-Intercepts
- $y$-Intercepts
- Critical points
- Intersections

> [!NOTE]
> Note that all equations $y = f(x)$ must be inputted in the form `f(x) - y`.
> To input multiple equations, separate each equation with a `|` character.
